# metrobus-repairs-nlp-workshop
Workshop which demonstrates how to use nlp to categorize bus repairs for a city metro area.

Problem:  how can bus drivers notify maintenance that there may be a problem with their bus?

Solution:  at the end of their shift, when bus drivers check out, they can enter a textual description of what issue is occuring.  e.g. when I press on the brakes they squeal.  The NLP model will take in the textual description and classify it as:  brake, starter, engine, other, and send a report to maintenance.

Maintenance will pick up the report and then investigate the repair claim.
